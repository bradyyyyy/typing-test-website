DESIGN PLAN:


FRONTEND
1. UI
    - light, faded quote of text that displays what needs to be typed.
    - what the user types, is overlayed over the quote.
    - if the letter typed is correct, it turns white. If the letter typed is incorrect, it turns red.
    - results page that at minimum shows wpm, accuracy, time, number of total characters typed correctly, incorrectly, and total.

2. Languages/Frameworks
    - HTML for structure
    - CSS for style
    - Javascript for the backend logic
    - Potentially React for more appealing UI elements.

BACKEND
1. API
    - GET text : fetch the text that the user will type
    - POST results : submit the results of the typing test for storage/processing
    - GET leaderboard : show the top typists (maybe)

2. Logic:
    - User Auth: Allow for users to create accounts, login, and save typing history (maybe)
    - Results: Calculate typing speed, accuracy, characers typed, etc

3. Technologies
    - Node.js/Express: for building the API/logic
    - Database: MongoDB to store user data, test results, and possibly leaderboard information.
